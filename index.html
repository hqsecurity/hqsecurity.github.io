      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The duty of a security officer is to secure the client's property. To accomplish this, an officer</p>
        <ul>
          <li>observes and reports notable events</li>
          <li>controls access to client properties</li>
          <li>conducts regular patrols of those properties</li>
        </ul>
      <p>and assumes other duties, as directed.</p>
      <p>This manual outlines the basic skills every new officer needs to know upon completion of his or her 3-day training period. 
      Therefore, senior officers should use this manual as a checklist to guide them as they train new officers, to ensure that no essential skills are overlooked.</p>

        <h3>Log into a Computer Profile</h3>
        <p>All security posts at client sites are provided with desktop computers for security use. Once booted, these computers will show a screen requiring a username and password to continue into a computer profile. All new security officers will be set up with their own username and password. </p>
        <p>Every profile username follows a particular naming convention, in this order:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The <strong>first five letters</strong> of the profile owner’s <strong>last name</strong>, and</li>
            <li>the <strong>first three letters</strong> of the owner’s <strong>first name</strong>.</li>
          </ol>
        <p>The first letter of each sequence is capitalized, and there are no spaces between them.</p>
        <p>For example, if your name were <strong>Jane Smithson</strong>, your profile username would be</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
          <li><h4>SmithJan</h4></li>
        </ul>
        <p>A starter password will also be provided to you. (Be careful that you type in the correct password. Too many failed attempts to enter the correct password will lock you out of your profile.) 
         Once you have entered your username and starter password, the screen will prompt you to change your password. Follow the onscreen directions.</p>
        <p>If all steps are fulfilled, a standard Windows start screen will load.</p>
        <p>In summary:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Enter username according to this convention: first five letters of last name + first three letters of first name.</li>
              <li>Carefully enter starter password.</li>
              <li>Follow onscreen prompts to change password.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: For security purposes, your profile’s password will be reset every few months. Entering a correct username and password will yield onscreen directions to change your password. Follow them closely.</p>
            <p><i>If you get locked out of your profile, contact the IT HelpDesk or your supervisor.</i></p>

            <h4 id="TermProcedure">Termination Procedure</h4>
            <p>In the event that an employee is terminated, you must immediately deactive that employee's profile and remove their access credentials
            in the Genetec system.</p>
            <p>It's important that a member of the security procures the access badge of the terminated employee.
              Usually, a member of HR will hand it in, but sometimes the employee will hand it in on his or her last day. Once the corresponding profile
            has been deactivated, the badge <strong>must be placed inside the Pro-Shredder box</strong> located the security break room/office.</p>
            <h5>Deactivating Profiles within Genetec</h5>
            <ol>
              <li>Deactivate the Profile</li>
              <li>Add " - Terminated" to the Last Name bar of the Profile</li>
              <li>Remove all access from the credential tab in the Profile</li>
              <li>Click "Save and Close"</li>
            </ol>
              <h6>Deactivate the Profile</h6>
